Source code to my old Roblox Condo site
All varibles are on the top of the PHP files

[For support dm me on Discord ](https://www.discord.com/users/378746510596243458)

# Lists of known sites using my code:
- [Celestial Condos](https://celestialcondos.com/) (Removed my credits)
- [Astral Society](https://astralsociety.xyz/) (Don't think they use the site anymore)


# Notes
* Don't put alot of gameIds (if you do you need to optimise the checker.)
* UI will not work on phones (too small)
* The blur on the game page can lag bad end PCs (or just chrome)

# WIPs
- [x] Add custom embed config
- [x] Adding credits to me
- [ ] Try and optimise code
- [ ] Add a update detecter (will add msg when I release a new update) (close)
- [ ] Make the Discord link just open Discord (Scrapped as of now do to it being blocked)
